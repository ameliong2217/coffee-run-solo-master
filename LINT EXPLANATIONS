usability under Android was not changed as being index searchable by google is not neccessary for the purpose of this project

Groovy
--potentally confuding code construct - referencing a read only file, not necessary to the code itself. 
--probable bugs -- result of new node is ignored - the style that this code is written is correct and performs it's function, analysis is 
just expecting and equal sign where one is not neccessary

Java
--empty method - getter methods are present for testing purposes and are fine as empty methods. 
--Same return value - suppressed as it's serving as a getter method once again for testing purposes
--character state-- param not used - contructor for testing inputs
--get current state -- not used -- used for testing purposes
--dispose- gone in all but one or two places where it was a necessary and used method. 

typos 

- unfixed. The majority of "typos" are from asset titles which I find uneccesarry to change as they are still very clear regarding content,
as well as a few variables or where it's expecting capitalization but capitalization is intentionally unused for distinction purposes.
